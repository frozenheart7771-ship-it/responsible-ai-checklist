# Responsible AI Checklist

This repository contains practical guidance and simple checklists for the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence in organisations.

It is written for business leaders, managers, educators, and teams who are already using AI tools in their daily work — often without clear governance, policies, or oversight.

The goal of this repository is not to promote technology, but to reduce risk, increase accountability, and encourage thoughtful adoption of AI.

## Why this repository exists

In many organisations today, AI is being used quietly.

Employees use AI tools to:
- draft emails and reports
- summarise documents
- analyse data
- generate ideas and content

Most of this usage happens without formal approval, training, or clear rules. This creates what is often called **Shadow AI** — the unmanaged use of AI tools inside organisations.

The risk is usually not the AI tool itself.

The real risk comes from:
- lack of visibility
- lack of ownership
- lack of human review
- exposure of sensitive data
- unclear accountability when something goes wrong

This repository exists to address these issues in a simple, practical way.

## Who this is for

This repository is intended for:

- Business leaders and managers
- Compliance and risk professionals

It is **not** written for software engineers or researchers only.  
No technical background is required.

## Core principles behind this work

The ideas in this repository are guided by a few simple principles:

- AI should support human decision-making, not replace accountability
- Every AI output must have a human owner
- Sensitive data requires extra care and restraint
- Transparency matters more than speed
- Governance should enable trust, not fear

Responsible AI does not start with complex frameworks.  
It starts with clear thinking and good habits.
