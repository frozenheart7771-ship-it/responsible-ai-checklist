# Responsible AI Checklist – A Practical Tool for Teams

## What is this?
This is a simple, actionable checklist for any professional or team using AI tools (like ChatGPT, Copilot, Midjourney, etc.). Its goal is to prevent common AI risks **before** they happen.

## Why did I create it?
Most AI governance fails because it's too complex. Teams need a **simple starting point**—a habit of pausing and asking the right questions. This checklist turns abstract "AI ethics" into a daily practice.

## How to use it
1.  **Download** the [Word template](responsible-ai-checklist-template.docx) or copy the checklist below.
2.  **Share it** with your team before starting any AI-assisted work.
3.  **Go through each question** together before finalizing any AI-generated output.
4.  **Keep it visible**—pin it to your team's channel or project board.

## The Checklist (Core Version)

### Before You Start
1.  ❔ **Have we identified a named owner for this AI-assisted task?**
2.  🛡️ **Are we clear on what data is OFF-LIMITS for upload (e.g., customer PII, internal strategy)?**

### During Use
3.  🔍 **Is a human reviewing the AI's output step-by-step, not just the final result?**
4.  📊 **Can we explain why we trust this output? If not, we verify.**
5.  ⚠️ **Has the AI suggested anything unsafe, biased, or legally risky?**
6.  🌐 **Do we know where this AI tool stores and processes our data?**

### Before Sharing
7.  👁️ **Would we be comfortable if this output became public or was seen by our CEO?**
8.  ✅ **Has the final human owner approved and signed off?**
9.  📁 **Is this decision logged (e.g., in a ticket, memo, or chat thread) for future accountability?**

## This is part of a bigger idea
This checklist is a practical step toward **operational AI governance**. It aligns with frameworks like **"Accountability Triggers"** — designing systems where safety and human oversight are built into the workflow, not added as an afterthought.
